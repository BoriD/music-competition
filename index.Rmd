It is impossible to understand music streaming earnings outside the context of the music market or the music industry. Music streaming royalty rates and distribution methods largely follow long-established practices and regulations concerning valuing intellectual property, accounting for royalties, and regulating the administration of music copyrights and neighbouring rights. Music streaming competes with other uses of music, such as public performances in television and radio broadcasting, or digital downloads. It cannot be analysed in isolation from the volume and price trends of public performance, mechanical licensing, and home copying.

In the past years, there has been an increased interest in analysing online platforms where the consumers do not pay a price.  Watching a music video on YouTube, or reading amusing content on Facebook, finding accommodation on AirBnB does not cost anything for the buyer money, though the buyer’s time in viewing advertisement, the buyer’s data footprint, or a commission from a two-sided product (the supply side of a rented room) offers a compensation for the platform. As a recent CMA study pointed out, such practices are probably originated from the use of music and audiovisual content on radio and television [@cma_online_platforms_advertising_2020]. Most uses of recorded music take place without the user paying for fit.

In the last decade, global online platforms have fundamentally changed the music business.  Streaming music on various platforms has became a very important distribution channel and music discovery location for creators and producers. First in the European Union, then in the United Kingdom a very lively public debate evolved around the changes that this new form of music has brought to the music industry. In 2022, following a parliamentary inquiry and a copyright-law based study by the UK Intellectual Property Office decided to carry out a full market study of music streaming.

The statement of scope for the CMA Music and streaming market study [@cma_market_study_scope_2022] intends to explore a range of factors that require a formal market definition, because they need to quantify market power, or how ad-funded music streaming, premium subscriptions, and user-uploaded content platforms such as YouTube and how they compete with one another. This analysis can only be conducted with a relevant product/service scope and geographical scope.

While the scoping statement does not have a formal market definition, it implies a national UK market that includes music streaming, UUC streaming and physical music sales, but not the broadcasting and retransmission of music, or the licensing of music for live performances, or as background music. This is supported by a simplified value chain that is different from the standard “three income streams” model applied by the music industry both in the U.S. and Europe.  It is questionable that this product definition is correct and can be justified. 

The scoping statement claims that "music streaming services are now the predominant means of music consumption, supplanting traditional physical media such as CDs and vinyl." We believe that this statement is a hypothesis, not a fact, because it contradicts how the music value chain is understood in the United States [@hull_music_2011] or in Europe [@leurdijk_statistical_2012-1; @leurdijk_statistical_2012]. If we apply the UK version of the relevant market definition [@office_of_fair_trading_market_2004], starting with music streaming as the focal product, it would be very difficult to justify the exlclusion of radio and television broadcasting and retransmission as potential substitutes for the use of music streaming services or physical media. We believe that there is sufficient demand- and supply side substitution taking place among licensed streaming, radio broadcasting and retransmission at least that pricing practices of the industry treat these alternative sales channels as market comparators for each other. 

The questionable market definition may not be independent from the starting point of the CMA scoping statement that "music streaming services have helped to restore growth in the sector and made it easier for new artists to share their music." As we show in our paper, the idea of growth is very difficult to verify empirically, and it should be formulated more as a hypothesis than as a  statement. Our empirical analysis found that growth is located in narrow segments of music---a general devaluation of the music, falling prices may lead to flat or falling revenues even with growing quantities used, and a large part of the music ecosystem may not experience any growth at all.

Our dynamic [The Relevant Market for Music Streaming: Market Definition and Measurement Challanges](https://music-competition.dataobservatory.eu/) document is a versioned work-in-progress publication, available from the Zenodo open science repository. It is built upon the actual application of competition law in non-UK jurisdictions [@antal_szabad_2017_en; @antal_pcr_croatia_2019], and it is intended for further research and publication. After reviewing some methods to empirically collect data about quantities, prices, market shares and market power in the music markets, we present some ideas on the definition of music markets.

The analysis we have carried out in other jurisdictions showed that UUC overtook music streaming and often came close to the radio broadcasting exactly because it operated in a vastly different market environment. In the previous decade, the various representative associations of composers [@gesac_regulatory_2015; @gesac_copyright_2015; @cisac_cisac_2017], performers [@aepo-artis_give_2016; @aepo-artis_comments_2017], and producers [@moore_value_2016] in Europe were all strongly calling for a change in these practices which were made. A re-regulation of UUC in the European Union is under way with the recent EU copyright directive [@eu_directive_2019_790], which, due to Brexit, is not applicable in the UK. As the scoping statement correctly describes, the monetization of UUC is fundamentally different from the other licensing models that are governed by international copyright and neighboring rights law. The UUC service providers, at least, in the United Kingdom, can negotiate with rightsholders after (rather than before) the music is used; opt to take down specific instances of music as an alternative to paying for its use; and do not bear the costs of any unidentified music rights being used.

The UK Intellectual Property Office is investigating to introduce on a separate legal basis in the UK, but there has not even been a proposal for this. In the UK, there is no regulatory mechanism that would bring the UUC segment closer to "normally" licensed streaming, and one could hypothetise that radio and retransmission is a closer substitute of music streaming than UUC.

Our paper proposes for the analysis of the UK music markets the use of our *full-market comparators* model, which gives a broader view of the music industry, and which has been applied in competition law based analysis as well as in price setting in other jurisdictions (relevant geographical markets.) It is based on the widely accepted value chain of the three income streams model [@hull_music_2011; @leurdijk_statistical_2012-1; @leurdijk_statistical_2012] and actual pricing practice in the industry, which are in turn based on more general pricing models of intellectual property [@pwc_valuing_2008; @ifrs_fair_value_2011; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019]. Yet, even the application of this comprehensive model is difficult when the ambition of understanding market power is considered. In the recent year, it has been pointed out many times that the traditional market definition of the relevant market is difficult at best with two-sided platforms like YouTube or when users are facing zero prices. The SSNIP test can be, theoretically, applied in the cases of YouTube, radio stations, or ad-supported streaming, however, the actual analysis is very difficult, because the implicit price used must be based on the advertisement revenues [@oecd_rethinking_2018; @support_study_commission_2021]. Our full-market comparator does exactly this, but the estimation problems are considerable.

In the market where we have conducted detailed surveys, the biggest volume of music was used in zero-price forms--mainly in radio, followed by UUC streaming, home copying, but also ad-supported music streaming had measurable market shares. The music use overlaps with commercialized forms of music consumption, and participation on non-commercialized uses (such a liturgical music, authentic folk music, and some no longer protect classical works.) Home copying is also a very significant use, and it varies across jurisdictions if it an exception from copyright law (and compensated following loosely the mechanical licensing model, like in the United Kingdom and in almost all European jurisdictins) or it is seen as an illegal non-market use. 

In a market where consumer prices are zero, the implied prices must be calculated on the basis of the revenues collected by the platform to finance this supply and the volumen of the consumption. One particular problem may be that the relevant revenue is not available--for example, YouTube is not calculating or making available its advertising revenues for the UK geographic segment, because it falls below the treshold where such disclosure would be mandatory under its accounting standards. And of course, it may be difficult to measure the UK-based use, too.

```


Following best statistical practice, we use the ICET model and the so-called cultural access and participation surveys to capture the use of paid and not paid, commercial and non-commercial uses of music in a systematic way [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012; @de_haan_virtuele_2008; @de_haan_nowadays_2012]. While CAP surveys give a biased measurement of use hours, we do not see evidence that they give a biased estimate of use ratios, which is necessary for our models weights. With almost no exception, in the music markets we could observe revenues, not prices, and we gave a priority to the use of observarable market transactions [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @commission_regulation_2012_1255]. Our model's understanding of price (which often cannot be directly observed, only calculated from revenues and volumes) was partly based on _Valuing the use of recorded music_, an excellent methodological guide created by PriceWaterhouseCoopers for IFPI [@pwc_valuing_2008], and the various globally applicable WIPO and IFRS standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019] on valuing copyrights in more practical terms for the music industry.

```

As one can see from our graphic figures, the music business has a particularly complicated value chain, because music is a copyright-based intellectual property with a very complex licensing system. Each music recording is a bundle of copyrights and neighboring rights, which are often remunerated separately.  Furthermore, in terms of the largest volume of use, the user is not paying for it directly. This makes the empirical analysis particularly challenging.

We assume from the language of the scoping report that the DCSM’s working definition is that of a UK national relevant market. In our experience with competition law-based market analysis in other jurisdictions, this is indeed the best point of view, but poses its own challenges. As we have shown in the [Music Creator Earnings' Project](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era/) initiated by the UKIPO, the British music industry is so interwoven with the national music industry, that it is next to impossible to obtain relevant market figures for the United Kingdom alone.

The new platforms that make music avaiable for literally billions of people are global: YouTube can be accessed almost anywhere on Earth, and Spotify is selling subscriptions in more than 200 countries and territories [@spotify_where_2022]. They are competing with radio and music television broadcasting and retransmission which is licensed territorially, and very often to less than national territories---for example, Ofcom licenses commercial radio stations to as small territories as "West Central Scotland." From an economic or competition law point of view, zero prices are difficult to work with. A geographically unrestricted access makes the empirical observation or estimation of prices very challenging.

Most undertakings of the music industry, wherever they are located in the value chain, are micro- or small enterprises, and therefore enjoy the benefits of simplified tax returns, exemption from most mandatory statistical filings, and the disclosures of simplified financial statements.  Unfortunately, these are the actual sources of official government economic statistics, which, therefore, exclude the music industry. The best known music industry reports are created by membership-based trade organizations with surveying these microenterprises. The management information systems and accounting systems of these microenterprises are usually not sophisticated enough to record revenues by geographic segments, or to apply an auditable use of currency translations --- in fact, most music enterprises are so small that they do not audit their disclosures. In our experience this means that there is no verifiable source of domestic, nationl and export income, rather a mixture of global income is reported.

The way music royalties are accounted for and get paid is different in the various sales formats of music. Mechanical royalties are paid upfront in lump sum, public peformance royalties are paid per annum, and streaming royalties are accrued until reaching a treshold.  In practice this means that many UK music busineses reported streaming income very difficult to connect to a consistent timeframe, geographic segment, and a proper weight of exchange rates. We there are many arguments for analying music streaming within the geographical scope of a national UK maket, we demonstrate that such an analysis is easier said than done. In our paper we draw the attention to computer simulations that we made for the Music Creators' Earning report.

In our experience, most music undertakings and their trade associations are not equipped with the data processing and statistical capacity to do so, not to mention the typically micro- or small enterprise sized undertakings. This is the problem that the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), a working demo of the planned European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central & Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014, in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem [@artisjus_measuring_2014]. By 2019, CEEMID had collected information on 20 European markets, including the United Kingdom, and processed data on far more markets---this data has been used in various competition law based analysis and modelling outside of the United Kingdom.

The idea of this observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the observatory's only (former) British users, via the _Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group_ to the _Economics of music streaming review_ of the DCMS Committee [@dcms_state51_2020; @antal_ceereport_2020]. The *state51 music group*, through its distribution arm, has been supporting the creation of the largest ever European market report, the [Central European Music Industry Report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/), and supported the creation of the CEEMID-CI indexes, which, for the first time provided a stock-index type of view from an individual rightsholder’s perspective on volume and price movements in the UK and in other countries [@antal_ceereport_2020]. The state51 music group drew attention to the observatory approach and this work in the *Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee* (DCMS) Select Committee of the British House of Commons. The *Music Creator Earnings' Project*, that created the Intellectual Property Office's [Music Creator Earnings' in the Digital Era](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era) report individually contacted the Digital Music Observatory (successor of CEEMID) and state51, and eventually with the permission of state51, the project commissioned our report that re-uses the CEEMID-CI indexes. The MCE project also committed to share data in the Digital Music Observatory. 

This paper grew out of the analysis we have provided for the *Music Creator Earnings' Project*, hat created the Intellectual Property Office's [Music Creator Earnings' in the Digital Era](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era) report [@antal_mce_2021].  We were tasked with providing longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade. Eventually that analysis only got a single paragraph and a footnote in the *Music creators’ earnings in the digital era* report and was published as an accompanying document *independently* of the main report, [An Empirical Analysis of Music Streaming Revenues and Their Distribution](https://reprex.nl/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/).

We hope that our paper will be a useful contribution to understanding the music markets of the United Kingdom, and contribute to several important questions: 
- We hope that our *full market comparator model* is a useful tool to map all the quantities, revenues and implied prices of the music value chain, and understand the potential of supply- and demand side substitution in the market.
- Correctly attributing the revenues of small undertakings to the appropriate timeframe and geographical segment, and applying the correct exchange rate can bring much clarity to the relative performance of the UK undertakings domestic and export markets.
