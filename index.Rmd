# Executive Summary {-}

> Do not use or cite this report yet.  It is a preliminary document based on [An Empirical Analysis of Music Streaming Revenues and Their Distribution](https://reprex.nl/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/) and will go through a very thorough re-editing, leaving irrelevant parts out, and adding more relevant parts from a competition economics and competition law point of view [@antal_mce_2021].

Regarding the key questions, the CMA *Music and streaming market study* must have a working definition of the relevant market under scrutiny, both in the sense of the product/service offered and the geographical scope of the market [@cma_market_study_scope_2022]. As various inquiries of other antitrust authorities have shown, neither question is very straightforward. The music industry is both very local and global at the same time.  Most music creators and music creators have mainly sub-national markets, but certain market practices, model contracts and distribution services follow a global practice, global standards or even global agreements.  Whilst raising the issue of the relevant market may appear legalistic and perfectionalist, in fact, the lack of a strong working definition of the relevant market makes empirical observation next to impossible.

The music value chain model employed in the scoping report is an extremely simplified version of the traditionally used music value chain models for the United States [@hull_music_2011] later adopted to Europe [@leurdijk_statistical_2012-1; @leurdijk_statistical_2012]. A more extended view of the value chain reveals that some elements of the value chain are open to competition on a sub-national level, others are on a national level, and others on an international, perhaps even global level. Because of the narrow and simplistic value chain applied by the DCSM committee and the [Intellectual Property Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office) as a starting point, which are recognized inputs of the SMA *scoping paper*, the weight of streaming appears to be very high.  But it is questionable that streaming really dominates the music ecosystem.

If the CMA believes that the relevant product market is music streaming, and not music, or at least recorded music, then it must assume tacitly that the undertakings in music streaming can act in relative independence form other parts of the music industry, for example, from broadcast music, the sale of physical formats, or even live music.  This is a questionable starting point, because many other analyses of music markets in other jurisdictions found that music streaming plays a smaller role in streaming.   Current price setting practices, at least, known to us, do not set streaming prices fully independently of the broader recorded industry. 

Recorded music (and partly live music) are copyright-based industries, which are exploiting the artificial monopolies created by intellectual property law, in the UK, the songwriter or publishing right and the recording (producer and performer rights.)  These valuable rights are granted by national jurisdictions, but they are largely governed by international law.  International law has at least two layers --- the United Kingdom until recently applied EU law, which created a closer harmonization of some aspects of the international copyright law.  The streaming part of the music business is shaped by global companies that take advantage of the highly international nature of these rights. Based on these national rights, which are harmonized on an international level, many model contracts have been developed that cannot be realistically changed by a UK entity.

We assume from the language of the scoping report that the DCSM’s working definition is that of a UK national relevant market.  In our experience with competition law-based market analysis in other jurisdictions, this is indeed the best point of view, but only when a broader recorded music industry is considered.  Nevertheless, we have experienced in the [Music Creator Earnings' Project](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era/) initiated by the UKIPO that currently the British music industry is so interwoven with the national music industry, that it is next to impossible to obtain relevant market figures for the United Kingdom alone. Our paper is based on a report that we made within the scope of this project, but which has only found a place in a single paragraph and a footnote of the *Music creators’ earnings in the digital era* report and was paid for but published as an accompanying document *independently* of the main report.

## Lack of truly UK market data source {-}

To enlighten this point, and to focus our contribution, we would like to draw the reader’s attention to the fact that most publicly available music industry reports, or findings submitted to the DCMS committee do not transparently separate the revenues of the UK music industry to domestic and overseas revenues.  Furthermore, the overseas revenues are not reported by major (geographical) markets or currencies.

Music industry reports are often complied by surveying members of music organizations, such as BPI or IFPI.  The questionnaires of these surveys do not make an auditable distinction between the domestic and foreign revenues of the surveyed entities.  These surveys ask for reporting only UK revenues, but for non-international undertakings, i.e., for independent entities, it is questionable if a proper segmentation of their revenues exists in their accounting systems, because they are usually small and medium sized enterprises that usually disclose some form of simplified financial reports and file simplified tax returns. In our understanding, currently no reliable public or non-public source exists to define the annual domestic (UK only) revenues, prices, and sales volumes of the UK music industry.

We explain in our working paper this problem in detail, but in short, music companies (both on the publishing and the recording side) receive their revenues from each national jurisdiction when it reaches a critical trashold that makes the payout feasible.  A UK-based music company may technically sell its portfolio of works (on the publishing side) or recordings (on the recording side) in at least 90 jurisdictions. As the most important music markets of the world use the US dollar or the euro as their functional currencies, much of these revenues are accrued in these functional currencies, but some of the revenues are made in a dozen of other currencies.  The median (typical) income of each work or song is zero, and only a relatively small majority of undertakings make a very small income in each royalty payment period. This earning is on average far below the cost of payment of this earning. Therefore, music distributors keep accruing such earnings till it reaches a threshold that is worth paying out.  In music streaming, the royalty periods are monthly, but most undertakings in most jurisdictions make far less than the minimum payable sum in each month.  Their payment is made whenever they reach the critical threshold, using the spot GBP exchange rate at the end of the royalty payment in question.

Because the monthly (and in most markets, the annual) earning of a British music company is immaterial in each payment period, the earnings are accruing for a hard to specify amount of time. And because the sums are individually immaterial, the currency translations are usually not made in a transparent manner, and certainly do not get reported.  Our paper shows that in the period 2015-2019 most of the seaming ‘revenue gain’ of the British music industry was due to the fact of the devaluation of the British pound and an inflated and belated payment of dollar and euro-based income, even though the typical earning in the UK and 19 compared markets was at best flat or decreasing.

In our view, any empirical analysis of the UK music streaming market requires a very advanced financial modelling of exchange rates, and a very complicated delineation of the UK music industries truly domestic and foreign revenues. What makes this analysis important is that without this delineation, the two most important market variables, i.e., volume and price cannot be observed.  Streaming companies pay royalties every month, using a monthly fluctuating price per stream.  It is essential observe to the UK volumes and UK prices separately if one takes the view of a national relevant market.

The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because British artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.

While total earnings are reported by international and national organizations, they hide five important economic variables: changes in sales volumes, changes in prices, market share on various national jurisdictions (which have their own volume and price movements), the exchange rates applied, and the share of the repertoire exploited. Even worse, the global music industry has no comprehensive database of rightsholders, music works, and recordings. Many rights are represented by heirs or passive investors. And because of the enormous number of works and recordings, in any given royalty payment period, most works/recordings are not used and not compensated. The lack of a known population and distribution makes usual indicators as average or median earnings arithmetically impossible to compute, and the large number of disused works and recordings makes even the estimation of the typical (median) value useless for economic analysis. The estimation of the arithmetic mean is equally problematic, because it is distorted by the earnings of very few global stars. To understand the streaming economy from the perspective of a typical or average rightsholder, or from the perspective of a small independent label or music publisher, requires very challenging sampling techniques either in surveying or in empirically observing and aggregating data from royalty accounts.

## Lack of market transparency {-}

National and international music organizations are not equipped with the data processing and statistical capacity to do so, not to mention the typically micro- or small enterprise sized undertakings. This is the problem that the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), a working demo of the planned European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central & Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014, in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem. By 2019, CEEMID had collected information on 20 European markets, including the United Kingdom, and processed data on far more markets---this data has been used in various competition law based analysis and modelling outside of the United Kingdom.

The idea of this observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the observatory's only (former) British users, via the _Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group_ to the _Economics of music streaming review_ of the DCMS Committee [@dcms_state51_2020; @antal_ceereport_2020]. The *state51 music group*, through its distribution arm, has been supporting the creation of the largest ever European market report, the [Central European Music Industry Report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/), and supported the creation of the CEEMID-CI indexes, which, for the first time provided a stock-index type of view from an individual rightsholder’s perspective on volume and price movements in the UK and in other countries. The state51 music group drew attention to the observatory approach and this work in the *Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee* (DCMS) Select Committee of the British House of Commons. The MCE project first individually contacted the Digital Music Observatory (successor of CEEMID) and state51, and eventually with the permission of state51, the project commissioned this report, which re-uses the CEEMID-CI indexes. The MCE project also committed to share data in the Digital Music Observatory.

Our Digital Music Observatory has been a proponent of making the market analysis internationally comparable and transparent.  The Digital Music Observatory full-market model on the volume side is based on the statistical standards [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012] and IFRS Fair Value standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @commission_regulation_2012_1255]. Its understanding of price (which often cannot be directly observed, only calculated from revenues and volumes) was partly based on _Valuing the use of recorded music_, an excellent methodological guide created by PriceWaterhouseCoopers for IFPI [@pwc_valuing_2008], and the various globally applicable WIPO and IFRS standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019] on valuing copyrights in more practical terms for the music industry.  It is important to recognize that IFRS, like copyright law, is international law, which is adopted or retained EU law in the United Kingdom, therefore most of our analysis in other jurisdictions is founded on the same or very simliar regulatory environment to the UK.

While we collected limited data in the UK market in primary data collection, we have used the Open Data Directive of the EU, which under a different name (Reuse of Public Sector Information) has been in effect in the United Kingdom before Brexit, and we did obtain primary music use data from such sources (i.e., harmonized EU surveys.)  None of our evidence suggests that the UK music markets are very different from other developed European music markets.  It is very unlikely that the UK music streaming business is more independent of the broader recorded music industry then in Austria, Germany, or upper middle-income countries like Hungary, Slovakia, or Croatia.  In these countries, music streaming does not generate the biggest volume of uses, and in most countries, it also does not generate the biggest revenue of recorded music (radio does.) We believe that a more careful delination of domestic and export revenues for the UK music industry would also reveal that the CMA study is overweighting music and underweighting radio and televions broadcasting, and various forms of cable and satellite retransmission of music.

## Too narrow market definition {-}

As we will show in our paper, in spite of the very low level of transparency, whatever data we see already points to an extremely concentrated market, where 1% of the actors control about 75% of the revenues. But the CMA scoping report uses an extremely narrow relevant market definition, which will make the already very high level of concentration look even higher. In our view, the dominant market players will correctly criticize findings about their conduct. If the market defintion is too narrow, while the market is extremely concentrated, we believe on the basis of the analysis of other national market analysis, the potential of horizontal abuse will be overstated, and likely hotly contested.

As mentioned earlier, we agree that the best practice is to work with the assumption of the territory of the United Kingdom as a geographically relevant market, but it will be impossible to empirically observe the UK market variables (volumes, prices, and revenues) without a careful delination from the rest of the world. The analysis must consider both the global market and the UK market. Yet we believe that the CMA scope of the relevant product/service market is unusually narrow compared to generally used descriptions of the music industry, and the product/service element of the relevant market in question.

A more seriuos problem is the very narrow product/service definition used in the scoping report. We believe that the market definition should either include at least the music broadcasting and retransmission segment, or exclude the UUC segment, too. In the past years a European consensus was formed around the view that the UUC segment is very different and must be re-regulated. Even though because of Brexit this consensus eventually excluded the United Kingdom, the UK Intellectual Property Office currently investigates the introduction of its key measures into UK law exactly due to the very similar problems. We are aware of the fact that in the UK policy debate around the DCMS inquiry some European regulatory approaches were presented as potential solutions to the problems of licensed music streaming (and indeed, several European jurisdictions made such adjustments), the European re-regulation was primarily intended to re-regulated the UUC segment (with making it compulsory to license it) and not the licensed music streaming segment. 

Even though the new EU directive on copyright certainly brings the regulation of UUC closer to that of music streaming [@eu_directive_2019_790], currently there is no similar UK (or US) regulation in place that would make the UUC segment and the licensed music segment suitably simiar in the way market transactions as contracted, priced, or regulated to talk about one market segment. However, on the other side of the spectrum, we believe that there is much evidence to be found (at least in other national markets) that music streaming is not independent from the music broadcasting and retransmissionn market segment, which, in many countries, has larger use volumes and larger revenues than streaming. In fact, we saw a high level of alignment among the music broadcast and retransmission segment, and the licenses music streaming segments, and we have seen document indicating that the parties in these segments do consider each other as comparators in their pricing decisions.  However, at least in the jurisdictions (and relevant national markets) we have seen data, the UUC segment worked rather independently from both broadasting/retransmissionn and streaming, and applied completely dissimilar sales conditions.

Therefore, we would treat it at best as a hypothesis to be tested that the UK music streaming works independently of the UK music broadcasting and retransmission market, and if the UK music streaming market is sufficiently homogenous to be analyzed as one product/service market if UUC is included. 

The analysis we have carried out in other jurisdictions showed that UUC overtook music streaming and often came close to the radio broadcasting exactly because it operated in a vastly different market environment. As the scoping report correctly acknowledged, UUC companies sought ex post agreement (pending non-take-down) from rightsholders based on ex post offered prices that in our analysis were at least 90% lower than music streaming or radio broadcast prices. In the previous decade, the various representative associations of composers [@gesac_regulatory_2015; @gesac_copyright_2015; @cisac_cisac_2017], performers [@aepo-artis_give_2016; @aepo-artis_comments_2017], and producers [@moore_value_2016] in Europe were all strongly calling for a change in these practices which were made, technically at least, illegal for the next decade.  We do not believe that the inclusion of UUC in music streaming and the parallel exclusion of broadcasting and retransmission can be justified with any market data (price, users/buyers, volumes, sales practices.)

To sum up, a meaningful competition economics analysis can be only made in a well-defined market where buyers and sellers have the potential to make market transactions among each other, and where the prices and other terms of the transactions are sufficiently similar. In our view, it is critically important to understand that difficulties of conduction a market analysis with a too narow product/service definition or without a trustworthy and auditable ex post delination of the UK and export revenues.
