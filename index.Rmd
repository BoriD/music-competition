# Executive Summary {-}

> Do not use or cite this report yet.  It is a preliminary document based on [An Empirical Analysis of Music Streaming Revenues and Their Distribution](https://reprex.nl/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/) and will go through a very thorough re-editing, leaving irrelevant parts out, and adding more relevant parts from a competition economics and competition law point of view [@antal_mce_2021].

It is impossible to understand music streaming earnings outside the context of the music market or the music business ecosystem. Music streaming royalty rates and distribution methods largely follow long-established practices and regulations concerning valuing intellectual property, accounting for royalties, and regulating the administration of copyrights and neighbouring rights. Music streaming competes with other uses, such as public performances in television and radio broadcasting, or digital downloads. Music streaming cannot be analysed in isolation from the volume and price trends of public performance, mechanical licensing, and home copying.

Regarding the key questions, the CMA *Music and streaming market study* must have a working definition of the relevant market under scrutiny, both in the sense of the product/service offered and the geographical scope of the market [@cma_market_study_scope_2022]. As various inquiries of other antitrust authorities into music have shown, neither question is very straightforward. The music industry is both very local and global at the same time. Most music creators and music creators have mainly sub-national markets, but certain market practices, model contracts and distribution services follow a global practice, global standards or even global agreements. Whilst raising the issue of the relevant market may appear legalistic and perfectionalist, in fact, the lack of a strong working definition of the relevant market makes empirical observation next to impossible.

Our **Working Paper** lays out some empirical observation and estimation strategies developed in the market analysis of several music markets, in two cases, related to the application of European competition law. We show that it is very difficult to collect reliable price and quantity data for the analysis of a national market.  The CMA market study will face many significant estimation challenges that we had to cope during similar studies in other countries.  It is very critical to have a very precise market definition, both in geographical and product sense, to start the collection of empirical data that relates to the correct geographic concept and the correct parts of the value chain. 

The second part of our **working paper** addresses too important questions in detail, that we only summarize now.  The music industry traditionally reports aggregated revenues, without quantity or concentration measures, which gives very little information for an economic assessment. The break up the revenues to prices and quantities, the basic variables of any economic analysis, we need to correctly collect and disintegrate data from the truly relevant market. We introduce our *full market comparator* model, which is essential a price setting tool for the music industry, but in this case, it can be also used the other way around: to see if prices are sufficiently homogeneous in the market definition applied by the scoping report. In the second part, we show how difficult it is to disintegrate the volume, price, and currency rate effects of streaming data.  If the CMA want to create a study on the UK market, and not the global market, this will be a critical task. Not only the national/domestic separation of the data, but the domestic/export separation of the data is difficult in practice. Our **simulation results** that after the cleaning of the exchange rate effect in the data how shockingly different picture emerges about the UK music streaming markets.

## The relevant product market {.unnumbered}

The music value chain model employed in the scoping report is an extremely simplified version of the traditionally used music value chain models for the United States [@hull_music_2011] later adopted to Europe [@leurdijk_statistical_2012-1; @leurdijk_statistical_2012]. A more extended view of the value chain reveals that some elements of the value chain are open to competition on a sub-national level, others are on a national level, and others on an international, perhaps even global level. Because of the narrow and simplistic value chain applied by the DCSM committee and the [Intellectual Property Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office) as a starting point, which are recognized inputs of the SMA *scoping paper*, the weight of streaming appears to be very high.  But it is questionable that streaming really dominates the music ecosystem.

If the CMA believes that the relevant product market is music streaming, and not music, or at least recorded music, then it must assume tacitly that the undertakings in music streaming can act in relative independence form other parts of the music industry, for example, from broadcast music, the sale of physical formats, or even live music. This is a questionable starting. First, our data in other countries (employing the full market comparator model) found contrary evidence, second, because music is licensed similarly in music streaming and broadcasting/transmission and dissimilarly in UUC. Current price setting practices, at least, known to us, do not set streaming prices fully independently of the broader recorded industry, with the exception of UUC.

Our Digital Music Observatory has been a proponent of making the market analysis internationally comparable and transparent.  The Digital Music Observatory full-market model on the volume side is based on the statistical standards [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012] and IFRS Fair Value standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @commission_regulation_2012_1255]. Its understanding of price (which often cannot be directly observed, only calculated from revenues and volumes) was partly based on _Valuing the use of recorded music_, an excellent methodological guide created by PriceWaterhouseCoopers for IFPI [@pwc_valuing_2008], and the various globally applicable WIPO and IFRS standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019] on valuing copyrights in more practical terms for the music industry.

At least in the markets analysed with this comprehensive tool originally developed for price setting in music markets, and took prices and quantities, harmonized to the same units, we would not subscribe to the market definition of the CMA Scoping Report.  What we have found in Hungary (repeatedly in several years) is that music streaming was more closely resembling the broadcasting and retransmission segment than the UUC segment.  This empirical observation can be well explained with the underlying regulation: in broadcasting/retransmission and music streaming the music is licensed, following the fair valuation standards and intellectual property standards.  In the observed period, UUC was not licensed in this sense, and as the scoping report correctly states, its prices are ex post set. 

To assess whether the market definition is correct, the starting point is usually test for the homogeneity of prices. As our case study shows that employing a national market view is well-founded both empirically (UK streaming prices differ greatly from other European prices) and they can be well explained by the underlying regulations governing royalties, i.e., the various intellectual property accounting and pricing standards set by IFRS, WIPO, and to a certain extent, the international copyright law concerning equitable remuneration.  We also show in our **working paper** that observing the UK market is still very challenging. Most of the market players are SMEs without sophisticated business management, accounting systems, and it is very difficult to correctly delineate their domestic and export revenues, or to correctly attribute them to a financial year, or to compare their differently priced, quoted, collected revenues. 

However, when analysing the product/service market, comparing prices is a huge undertaking.  We have done this in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, partly in connection to applying competition law. We will show a slightly stylized version of our full market comparator model for Hungary, where some business confidential inputs will change by random numbers that leaves the actual model resemble the actual, but not public outcome, which is subject an antitrust dispute. 

We find it questionable both from a regulatory and economic point of view that scoping report includes UUC in the broader music streaming umbrella, but excludes public performance licensing, particulary in radio and televion broadcasting and retransmission. The analysis we have carried out in other jurisdictions showed that UUC overtook music streaming and often came close to the radio broadcasting exactly because it operated in a vastly different market environment. As the scoping report correctly acknowledged, UUC companies sought ex post agreement (pending non-take-down) from rightsholders based on ex post offered prices. In our analysis outside the UK such prices were at least 90% lower than music streaming or radio broadcast prices. In the previous decade, the various representative associations of composers [@gesac_regulatory_2015; @gesac_copyright_2015; @cisac_cisac_2017], performers [@aepo-artis_give_2016; @aepo-artis_comments_2017], and producers [@moore_value_2016] in Europe were all strongly calling for a change in these practices which were made, technically at least, illegal for the next decade.  

A re-regulation of UUC in the European Union is under way with the recent EU copyright directive [@eu_directive_2019_790], which, due to Brexit, is not applicable in the UK. The UK Intellectual Property Office is investigating to introduce on a separate legal basis in the UK, but there has not even been a proposal for this. In the UK, there is no regulatory mechanism that would bring the UUC segment closer to radio, retransmission and licensed streaming.

Eventually, we believe that this question must be addressed with the analysis of prices.  We introduce in our **working paper** in detail the regulation and practice of music price setting.  In practice, we see a high level of alignment among the music broadcast and retransmission segment, and the licenses music streaming segments, and we have seen (non-public) documents indicating that the parties in these segments do consider each other as comparators in their pricing decisions.  However, at least in the jurisdictions (and relevant national markets) we have seen data, the UUC segment worked rather independently from both broadasting/retransmissionn and streaming, and applied completely dissimilar sales conditions.

Overall, we would not use the current relevant product/market in the scoping report, instead, our initial hypotheses would be pair-wise comparison of the integration of the broadcasting/retransmission, the physical (mechanical licensing), and the licensed streaming and UUP segment.  We believe that music in the radio, in music televion, vinyl and CD, home copyied files, and streaming subscriptions and UUC are competing with each other.  In our experience, streaming has no dominant role, and probably not even a leading role in the consumers music use basket.



## Assessing the geographical market definition {.unnumbered}

We assume from the language of the scoping report that the DCSM’s working definition is that of a UK national relevant market. In our experience with competition law-based market analysis in other jurisdictions, this is indeed the best point of view, but only when a broader recorded music industry is considered. Nevertheless, we have experienced in the [Music Creator Earnings' Project](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era/) initiated by the UKIPO that currently the British music industry is so interwoven with the national music industry, that it is next to impossible to obtain relevant market figures for the United Kingdom alone. Our paper is based on a report that we made within the scope of this project, but which has only found a place in a single paragraph and a footnote of the *Music creators’ earnings in the digital era* report and was paid for but published as an accompanying document *independently* of the main report. We have shown that against the commonly held view that the music streaming brought growth back to (recorded) music, for most UK entities, revenues were flat at most in the period of 2015-2019, and even this was due to the depreciation of the GBP that inflated the dollar, euro, and yen based revenues.



## Lack of market transparency {.unnumbered}


When price, quantity, and revenue is correctly set, it is important to get a sense of their dynamic movement and their concentration.  Revenues in the music value chain are extremely concentrated, as it was shown in the xxxxx, and as we have seen in the analysis of other music markets.  Our price observations, which include the UK and 19 countries, albeit not perfect, suggest declining prices and a very high level of concentration. This leaves next to no revenue in very large segments of the market. Our hypothesis is that the median income for every copyright protected work or recording is zero for every single royalty payment period in streaming, and we suspect that even on rightsholder level, the median income is zero or close to zero.

We have conducted various harmonized and representative surveys in several European countries to find out the revenues of rightsholders. Unfortunately, this was not possible in the xxxxxx, an the UK in Numbers survey offers very little comparison.  Yet, in other countries we would argue that in the recorded industry the growth is mainly extensive (new jurisdictions start to pay export revenues), and very uneven: some players growth, but the typical rightsholder is facing flat or diminishing revenues.  We observed a general devaluation of music in several markets, and our comparative data with the UK suggests that music is likely to be devaluing in the UK, too. This certainly has consumer benefits but combined with the vertical structure of music streaming configuration of the value chain, and the problems of UUC, these are not necessarily signs of a healthy competition. In fact, the heated policy debates around the re-regulation of streaming royalties, or in Europe, the re-definition of UUC show that many smaller market players find the current market situation unsustainable. 

National and international music organizations are not equipped with the data processing and statistical capacity to do so, not to mention the typically micro- or small enterprise sized undertakings. This is the problem that the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), a working demo of the planned European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central & Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014, in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem. By 2019, CEEMID had collected information on 20 European markets, including the United Kingdom, and processed data on far more markets---this data has been used in various competition law based analysis and modelling outside of the United Kingdom.

The idea of this observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the observatory's only (former) British users, via the _Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group_ to the _Economics of music streaming review_ of the DCMS Committee [@dcms_state51_2020; @antal_ceereport_2020]. The *state51 music group*, through its distribution arm, has been supporting the creation of the largest ever European market report, the [Central European Music Industry Report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/), and supported the creation of the CEEMID-CI indexes, which, for the first time provided a stock-index type of view from an individual rightsholder’s perspective on volume and price movements in the UK and in other countries. The state51 music group drew attention to the observatory approach and this work in the *Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee* (DCMS) Select Committee of the British House of Commons. The MCE project first individually contacted the Digital Music Observatory (successor of CEEMID) and state51, and eventually with the permission of state51, the project commissioned this report, which re-uses the CEEMID-CI indexes. The MCE project also committed to share data in the Digital Music Observatory.

While we collected limited data in the UK market in primary data collection, we have used the Open Data Directive of the EU, which under a different name (Reuse of Public Sector Information) has been in effect in the United Kingdom before Brexit, and we did obtain primary music use data from such sources (i.e., harmonized EU surveys.)  None of our evidence suggests that the UK music markets are very different from other developed European music markets.  It is very unlikely that the UK music streaming business is more independent of the broader recorded music industry then in Austria, Germany, or upper middle-income countries like Hungary, Slovakia, or Croatia.  In these countries, music streaming does not generate the biggest volume of uses, and in most countries, it also does not generate the biggest revenue of recorded music (radio does.) We believe that a more careful delination of domestic and export revenues for the UK music industry would also reveal that the CMA study is overweighting music and underweighting radio and televions broadcasting, and various forms of cable and satellite retransmission of music.
