# Price Harmonization and Valuation {#price-valuation}

The music industry is a very fragmented and concentrated economic sector, where most creators and enterprises are price takers without any pricing power.  Pricing is usually negotiated by representative national organizations (for mechanical and public performance licensing) or via labels and publishers of large rights portfolios in the hybrid licensing scheme of streaming,  and the special cases of ‘grand rights’, such as theatrical use, film ‘synchronization’ and advertisement.

Both the publishing and recording side of the industry is exploiting intellectual property, i.e. copyrights and neighboring rights, and gives licenses for the use of the music. The publishing side also licenses live performances, even in cases when the composer is present on the stage of the live performance.

Some forms of licensing, such as exploitation on theatrical stages, the price setting is completely unregulated---an artists or her publisher can freely negotiate with a theatre on the use of the music in a dramatic setting. This is, however, a small minority of the music uses. In most cases, there is some form of compulsory licensing in place. Until the emergence of music streaming, the buyer side of the music industry was so much more concentrated than the seller side, that for practical reasons, music was sold in bundles.  If an artist released a record, and gave a mandate to license this record to radio or television stations, it was not possible to revoke this license (it became part of a so-called ‘blanket license’).  In the absence of seller choice (the artist had no say on the actual sales volume, or price), various forms of regulated pricing schemes had been introdcued in the 20th century. 

Both the publishing and recording side of the industry is exploiting intellectual property, i.e. copyrights and neighboring rights, and gives licenses for the use of the music. The publishing side also licenses live performances, even in cases when the composer is present on the stage of the live performance.  The licensing policies are set by various forms of regulations on the exploitation of intellectual property.  Copyrights and neighboring rights are governed by international law, and in Europe, they are further harmonized by EU law.  Because the United Kingdom has harmonized its laws with the EU for four decades, at this moment, UK law is very similar to EU law.  The valuation principles of intellectual property are set by various standards set by the World Intellectual Property Organiztaion and the International Financal Reporting Standards Board.  The IFRS standards are incorporated into both UK and EU accounting law, and the WIPO standards have a similar international law underpinning as the more specific copyright and neighboring right. The valuation and price setting of music must comply with the broadest fair value principles (set by international financial reporting standards) in the light of the intellectual property standards set by WIPO.  At last, copyright and neighboring rights law have special provisions, often called as "equitable remuneration".  From an economic perspective, we treat equitable remuneration as a special case of fair valuation. Even when equitable remuneration is not literally applicable in the music industry, we believe that the broader fair valuation principle should yield a similar result. 

The music industry is a very global industry, and these international standards harmonize many aspects of music licensing.  The high level of global standardization had been one of the pre-requisites of the emergence of global music service providers like Spotify or Apple Music.

In a competition-based market study, the aim may not be the investigation of price setting, however, understanding the empirical difficulties in setting the prices is important to understand the difficulties and opportunities for any form of market analysis.

## Fair Value {#fair-value}
The concepts of copyright law, such as equitable remuneration, set a legal basis for the remuneration of creators, particularly in cases where the seller has no freedom of contracting the actual user.  Such rules, however, do not contain regulations on how to set the paiable sum---this often leads to a confusion. In the United Kindgom in 2020-21 there had been a lively debate about various forms of equitable remuneration. Yet it is not the equitable remuneration right that tells what should be the price applied when an artist is paid out.

This is not an unusual situation in modern market economies.  Owners of natural monopolies, or large corporate structures are not always allowed to freely negotiate prices. In the, European Union, copyrights are treated as constitutionally protected rights which are protected on an equal level with fair competition. Pricing in these cases usually follows some legal norm and economic principle.

Our understanding is that music prices should mainly follow the Fair Value standards, but they are also inspired by the more generan *Arm's length* principles: whenever a market transaction is not possible, the compulsory conditions should resemble of something that two market powers without power or proximitiy of interests (*at arm's length*) would agree to pay. 

In 2008, the global recording industry body, IFPI, published _Valuing the use of recorded music_,  created by PriceWaterhouseCooper [@pwc_valuing_2008]. This excellent methodological guide applies the WIPO and IFRS standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019] on valuing copyrights in more practical terms for the music industry.  The valuation principles are enshrined in the fair valuation principles of the WIPO, and the fair value principles of the International Financial Standards Board---their use is not a recommendation but statutory obligation in most IFRS countries.  This makes applications of valuation examples (particularly in competition practice) from other countries, Slovakia and Hungary in this case, largely applicable in the United Kingdom.

The recognized fair valuation principles stipulated that the “most applicable method” must be used in valuations, which almost always leaves out in copyright contests the (historical) “cost approach”, and leaves open the use of the “income approach” and the “market approach”.

The *income approach* compares the royalty flows of a work of its recording via the using an appropriate “discount rate.” When a user buys in a music store an mp3 file on 1 July 2015, it triggers a single royalty payment after the deductions of the cost of sale on the marketplace. In a streaming platform, the same user’s royalty payments appear every month when she listens to the song, and in radio, usually every year. The discount rate provides a proper comparison between remuneration received in July 2015 and April 2021.

The *market approach* tries to identify a payment rate, regardless of if it is made in lump sum, monthly or annually to established, sufficiently similar uses. Many ideas were tried internationally to identify the sufficiently similar use of music streaming; for example, relating ad-supported and automatically selected songs to radio streams, and relating cases where the user controls the selection of songs, and may even download them to music downloads. In this research report I do not try to review these cases, as many of them may be subject to litigation in various jurisdictions that apply both equitable remuneration and fair valuation principles, and similar principles of competition law.

The application of *fair valuation principles* is particularly challenging in the case of private copying, where the transactions are not recorded (as they are not market transactions) and in streaming, which is a relatively new technology that is seen in licensing as a mixture of earlier mechanical copy-based and public performance-based licensing, and has so many transactions that most rightsholders (and even their national organizations) like the data processing capacity to administer the rights or challenge incorrect payments.

Comparing  royalties is challenging because some royalties are paid upfront and for perpetuity (like in the case of the digital download model of mp3 music, mp4 audiovisual or epub book files); music streams are remunerated monthly, based on actual use; and public performance streams, such as broadcasting, are usually remunerated annually, in equitable proportion to the use of the works and recordings.  Furthermore, radio stations, for example, pay for both mechanical copying of music and making it available to the public. So direct comparison, as we will see in the subsequent chapters, requires a common unit of measure---we translate all rates to annual rates. 

The CEEMID full-market model (introdcued in [Music Use and Rightsholder Damages](#music-use) and [Enjoyment of Audiovisual Content and Rightsholder Damages](#av-use)) was partly based on _Valuing the use of recorded music_, an excellent methodological guide created by PriceWaterhouseCoopers for IFPI [@pwc_valuing_2008]. In our understanding, similar valuations presented here in this short example must meet high statistical standards [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012] and IFRS Fair Value standards [@ifrs_fair_value_2011; @commission_regulation_2012_1255] which had been adopted into EU law. 

```{r royalties, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Breaking Up Music Enjoyment Hours" }
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('plots', 'listen_hours_by_license_16x9.jpg'))
```

This was the framework that CEEMID, a cooperation of several European rightsholders including SOZA started to develop, when they started to cooperate on meeting the data requirements of these valuation techniques. It was used for royalty pricing and compensation claims in Hungary [@antal_szabad_2017_en; @antal_szabad_2018_en], Slovakia [@antal_slovenskom_hudobnom_2019_en] and Croatia [@antal_pcr_croatia_2019] are comparing per hour royalty revenues in various licensing and compensation models, therefore providing a common metric for mechanical, public performance, streaming and private copying compensation revenues. 

This model is based on a competition policy-based argument.  Radio stations, television, YouTube and streaming platforms are all competing for the attention of consumers, and they are competing with each other. In any minute when a user is listening to music or a podcast in a car, she is not listening to radio; when he is watching YouTube, he is not watching television.  And of course, when a vinyl record is played on a turntable at home, the digital radio is not playing.

## Equitable remuneration {#equitable-remuneration}

*Equitable remuneration* is a legal concept which has an economic aspect. In international law, it was first enshrined as Convention C100 of the ILO, stipulating that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work [@ilo_c100]. Within the context of international copyright law, it was introduced as a modification of the Berne Convention by the Rome Convention for the remuneration of the broadcasting of recorded fixation of music works (recordings) since 1971. This right is further elaborated by the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).These copyright conventions are administered by the WIPO [@wipo_copyright_treaty; @wipo_wppt].

The equitable remuneration is originally connected to a compulsory license that must be paid when recorded music is played on a publicly accessible location to the performing artists and music producers.The compulsory licensing means that the rightsholders are not in a position to negotiate the royalty rates, or deny use to any business entity. (Compulsory licensing never applies to private end-users.) The paiable rate is called *equitable* (and in some jurisdictions, *fair*), because it is not a negotiated, market rate. The law stipulates in these cases, however, that the rate must be set *as if* they have negotiated in a market transaction of two willing parties without monopoly (supplier power) or monopsony (buyer power) In economic terms, these rates must be set on a *fair value* basis.

The [scoping paper] correctly excludes the analysis of equitable remuneration from the scope of the UK market study. The equitable remuneration standards in international treaties do not set a standard on how to calculate equitable remuneration. In an international context, a study of Europe Economics and IVIR has shown that there are notable differences in how *equitable remuneration* is understood---and it is often used as a synonym to *fair* remuneration [@ivir_remuneration_2015]. In our understanding, the equitable remuneration should happen at \@ref(fair-value)[fair value](#fair-value) as defined by economics and international accounting standards.

It is sufficient to note that equitable remuneration is not a pricing issue, but it is an important legal mechanism to make sure that copyright and neighboring rightsholders are remunerated. In spite of the national differences, it is a sufficiently harmonized system that allows the functioning of the global music industry without major barriers, and therefore allows the comparison of revenues, prices and volumes, too. 


### Unlicensed streams and the value transfer to internet platforms {#unlicensed}

During the creation of this report a legislative process is under way to implement a new European legislation that aims to close the value transfer to unlicensed media platforms. Media platforms, like YouTube, unlike licensed music streaming services like Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music or licensed audiovisual services like Netflix, did not get a license from rightsholders for the use of their music, audiovisual content, literary or artworks. Their objection to such licenses were based on the safe harbor of copyright law mandated by the U.S. Congress to help the evolution of internet businesses. 

The representative associations of composers [@gesac_regulatory_2015; @gesac_copyright_2015; @cisac_cisac_2017], performers [@aepo-artis_give_2016; @aepo-artis_comments_2017], and producers [@moore_value_2016]  in Europe were all strongly calling for a change in these practices, while technology companies on the other side were vehemently lobbying European governments and members of the European Parliament to stop or water down proposals. Eventually the European Union adopted the new Copyright Directive  [@eu_directive_2019_790].  In the next two years all member states need to transpose it to national law.  It is very important that to give similar weight to modernizing the private copying remuneration and the value transfer to bring Slovak artists' and producer's revenues closer to the normal, European equitable remuneration.

In the context of the home copying, value transfer does not only undermine licensing to television and radios, but it also undermines the home copying compensation  scheme, too.

1. Unlicensed uses create an unlawful compensation to the business-to-business users of music, audiovisual content, books and other copyright protected content.  For exampe, televison stations and radio stations lost audiences to YouTube, because YouTube could offer programming "for free',  as it paid only about 1-10% of the similar royalties of broadcasters for content. This means that advertising revenue moved from TV and radio stations to YouTube.  This revenue should have been shared with rightsholder by the broadcasters.

2. The availability of unlicensed platforms, such as YouTube, that claims not to be a streaming platform, and pirate websites reduced demand for licensed, legalized use of copyright protected content.  The lower sales volumes, and the direct loss of advertisement revenues reduced the market price of content.

3. Because the private copying remuneration must be based on market values of music, filmed content, literary works, and other works, it is importnat that we enumerate the price loss due to illegal activities, so that the damage claim is truely based on arm's length market transactions, and not illegal transactions.


### Private Copying and Illegal Activities {#illegal}
In this report, we do not distinguish among various unlicensed uses of music. There are unlicensed uses that do not fall under the private copying exception, and therefore it should be persecuted by the Slovak state, and the rightsholders could claim damages from users on a different legal basis.

However, this distinction is rarely made in copyright administration and enforcement, because understanding the legal and technical nuances of the excempted and illegal use requires both copyright law and technical knowledge. Slovak authorities hardly use these distinctions: non-exempt private users are hardly ever persectued, and damages are hardly ever paid for rightsholders on a different legal basis. The distinction would be even more difficult to make for ordinary citizens, who are randomly invited to the survey interviews. Some illegal uses of music are also criminal activities, and it would be  unethical and produce unreliable results if we would ask people about criminal activities that would incriminate themselves.

Therefore, whenever they claimed that they copied unpaid music, films, series episodes, television programs, audiobooks on their devices, we used the term “unlicensed use” and we assumed that these cases should be compensated under the private copying regime. Of course, the rightsholders and the competent authorities of Slovakia may decide to choose a more nuanced approach, and litigate cases that may not fall under the private copying excemption on a different legal basis.
