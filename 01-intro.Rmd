# Empirical Measurement Challenges {#intro}

It is impossible to understand music streaming earnings outside the context of the music market or the music business ecosystem. Music streaming royalty rates and distribution methods largely follow long-established practices and regulations concerning valuing intellectual property, accounting for royalties, and regulating the administration of copyrights and neighbouring rights. Music streaming competes with other uses, such as public performances in television and radio broadcasting, or digital downloads. Music streaming cannot be analysed in isolation from the volume and price trends of public performance, mechanical licensing, and home copying.

This working paper grew out of the analysis we have provided for the *Music Creator Earnings' Project*, hat created the Intellectual Property Office's [Music Creator Earnings' in the Digital Era](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era) report [@antal_mce_2021].  We were tasked with providing longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade. We are reproducing some of our findings in this **working paper**, because they are related to the very same price and quantity movements that the CMA is investigating.

The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because BUS  artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.

The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports: the *Global Collection Reports* of CISAC for the author/publishing side of the industry, and the *Global Music Report* of the IFPI, which reports the recording (producer) side of the industry. These reports are not suitable for an economic market analysis, because they do not contain prices and quantities, only aggregated revenues. There are many national market studies are available, but only few of them make an effort to quote volume or use data and price data.  CISAC and IFPI are global organizations, and their reports are based on an internal survey of their members. Most industry reports are member self-reported studies.

The Hungarian, Slovak, and Croatian reports were based on independent market surveys [@antal_proart_2015; @antal_growth_2017; @antal_slovenskom_hudobnom_2019; @antal_pcr_croatia_2019].  They brought up many methodological challenges that a market study in the UK music industry must solve, too. Music organization usually do not possess the information that would be desirable for analysing the market from an economic point of view.  Surveying rightholders and users is very difficult, though, because neither rightsholder nor works or recordings have an authoritative description of their population. Only very advanced, inverse sampling techniques (which require very large amounts of data) can reveal price and volume movements when the analyst has no access to full transactional logs. 

This is the problem that the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), a working demo of the European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central & Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014 [@artisjus_measuring_2014], in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem. It was supposed to bring the seeminly data poor Central European countries to a level of data availability that allows better price setting or the creation of better creative industry policies or business strategies, but as experience showed, Western, more advanced, and future markets like Armenia share vey similar problems. The idea of CEEMID and later the Digital Music Observatory was to collect meaningful data that allows an economic analysis or economic valuation, i.e. it contains volume and price information.

In 2019 Consolidated Independent (member of the state51 music group) teamed up with CEEMID to make a showcase for a permanent, harmonized, international data collection program. The [Central European Music Industry Report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/) was prepared with the help of 60 music organizations in 12 countries, including the United Kingdom, and analysed rightsholders earnings in various distribution channels, including, but not limited to streaming, in 20 markets. The idea of this observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the observatory's only (former) British users, via the _Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group_ to the _Economics of music streaming review_ of the DCMS Committee [@dcms_state51_2020; @antal_ceereport_2020].

> "There are instructive initiatives in other industries in which there is perhaps a clearer and longer standing recognition of the role of economic analysis. This sometimes results in initiatives such as ‘Observatories’ like the European Market Observatory for Fisheries an Aquatorial Products or the European construction sector observatory […] These tend to be collaborative endeavours, with a varying mix of government, industry, economists and in some cases funding bodies. […] To date there have been few if any entities or initiatives for music similar to the above-mentioned observatories. We suggest this is something that policy makers can support and encourage, but which ultimately needs to be driven by the industry itself. […]
This is one reason we have worked with the economist Daniel Antal and his team, in particular on the Central European Music Industry Report 2020. Economists such as Daniel Antal produce data about the music industry that is consistent with international statistical standards and adhere to rigorous data ethics principles, seeking external validation through data and code repositories for underlying data and methodologies."

The data observatory concept is derived from Earth and natural sciences, where often many research stakeholders build large observation stations, such as the Hubble telescope in space, or CERN. Data observatories are often managed by a triangular stakeholder base of business, scientific, and policy stakeholders. The music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world's biggest data owners.

This was precisely the role of the former CEEMID  program, that was initiated by a few collective management societies after a dropped GESAC project. Starting out from three relatively data-poor countries, where data pooling allowed rightsholders to increase revenues, the CEEMID data collection program was extended by 2019 to 12 countries. It was eventually transformed into the [Demo Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) in 2020 [@antal_launching_music_observatory_2021], which is now open for any national rightsholder, stakeholder organization or music research institute.  In the UK, the Music Creators’ Earnings project, which created the Intellectual Property Offices' [Music Creator Earnings' Earnings in the Digital Era](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era/) relied on our data, particularly, with the kind approval of Consolidated Independent, the (re-)publication of our price and volume indexes.

Our working paper is divided into three subsequent chapters and conclusions.

Chapter 2 is divided into four subchapters: 

- \@ref(market-definition) introduces the considerations for defining the relevant product/service market after the consideration of the entire value chain of the music industry and the various problems related to defining the relevant market in terms of a national or global music market.
- \@ref(estimating-volumes) introduces the problems of estimating the most basic economic variable, the quantity or volume of the music used in the market. 
- Most publicly available information on music neither contains volumes or prices, we will investigate the possibility of observing or estimating prices in \@ref(estimating-prices). We show that because of the highly globalized nature of the music industry, a very careful attention must be paid to understanding the [functional currency](#functional-currency) used by entities in the market to report revenues (See \@ref(functional-currency)).
- \@ref(estimation-strategies) then overviews the potential empirical data sources and empirical [estimation strategies](#estimation-strategies) for obtaining quantity and price information for the relevant product/service market, from a relevant geographical segment, for an evidence-based market analysis.

Chapter \@ref(price-valuation) on [Price Harmonization and Valuation](#price-valuation) chapter deals with the price setting standards of the music industry, and the difficulties of price comparison in the various licensing modes of the industry. 
- In \@ref(fair-value) [Fair Value](#fair-value) we argue that from an economic point of view, the IFRS and WIPO standards on the fair valuation of intangible assets, including copyrights and neighboring rights, are practically more important for a market analysis, then the issue of [equitable remuneration](#equitable-remuneration)---and we believe that in the policy debate often these terms are used in confusion. 
- Then we introduce the problems of value transfer to [unlicensed platforms](#unlicensed) and we make the case that music streaming and UUC should not be treated as one market segment. 

Chapter \ref(simulation-results) contains simulation results that we prepared for the [Music Creator Earnings' Project](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era), however, they are even more useful for a competition analysis. 
- Our analysis shows that in many streaming markets, rightsholders, expressed in British pounds, experienced flat earnings, which was by a large extent due to the benevolent USD/GBP, EUR/GBP, and CHF/GBP exchange rates. It is likely that the majority of individual rightsholders experienced flat or diminishing revenues, and later releases brought less and less revenue per a thousand streams. A less benevolent exchange rate environment could have brought very large losses of revenue (See \@ref(exchange-rate-effects) for more details.)
- Our computer simulations show that UK rightsholders are experiencing a rather varied picture of music streaming. Because of the generally falling value of streams, short-lived hits are more impacted by value decline than perennial hits (See subchapters \@ref(difference-popularity) and \@ref(release-time).) Rightsholders with a diversified international audience are partly shielded by these effects (See \@ref(difference-international).) Younger stars and new genres generally experience a windfall from the pro-rata distribution system and older artists with more conventional genres such as rock or blues are experiencing headwinds. The publicly available market totals are hiding completely different market experiences.

Our report highlights some important lessons. First, we show that in the era of global music sales platforms it is impossible to understand the economics of music streaming without international data harmonization and advanced surveying and sampling. Paradoxically, without careful adjustments for accruals, market shares in jurisdictions, and disaggregation of price and volume changes, the UK industry cannot analyze its own economics because of its high level of integration to the global music economy. Furthermore, the replacement of former public performances, mechanical licensing, and private copying remunerations (which has been available for British rightsholders in their European markets for decades) with less valuable streaming licenses has left many rightsholders poorer. Making adjustments on the distribution system without modifying the definition of equitable remuneration rights or the pro-rata distribution scheme of streaming platforms opens up many conflicts while solving not enough fundamental problems.  Therefore, we suggest participation in international data harmonization and policy coordination to help regain the historical value of music.
